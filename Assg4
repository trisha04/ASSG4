Hadoop in Layman terms:
It can be segregated into four divisions or we can say modules

Distributed File System:-It allows data to be stored in a lucid format and moreover it is accessible accross a 
huge number of devices which are stored
Map reduce which provides the basic tools for pointing out the data
and will be further elaborated in the next point

Map Reduce- As the name suggests,putting the data into a suitable and desirable format ie MAP
and performing the mathematical calculations ie REDUCE

Hadoop Common-Provides tools needed for users computer that is the operating system ie Windows,Unix,etc

Yarn-manage resources of the system that are storing data and also running the analysis

Componenets of Hadoop Framework
1 Map Reduce-Sofware model for processing thehuge data sets in parallel

2.HDFS-All kinds of data are stored here without prior organisation

3.YARN-framework for scheduling and handling resource requests from applications

Reasons to learn Big data technologies:
Nowadays data sets are large enough.There are five reasons to learn the big data technologies;
1.No signs of slowing down

2.Everyone uses big data

3.Information managers are in demand

4.Lot of sofware options

5.We can learn another technologies
